# Audio Playback Rate Modification

I propose an implementation of a method that modify the playback of an audio signal, speeding it up or slowing it down, without affecting the frequency content, pitch, or intelligibility of the signal.

It consists of a MatLab function called 'audiomod.m' with arguments:

- input_audio: Input audio signal (mono).
- rate: Desired output audio rate.
- fs: Input audio sampling rate.

and the resulting output audio ('output_audio').

The pdf file 'report.pdf' contains a detailed description of the process and methodologies used.
